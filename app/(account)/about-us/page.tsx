        <DescriptionCard title='Our Story'>
          In 2019, four university friends crammed into a small studio in
          Berlin, Germany and started building doggycareer. They were united by
          a passion to help people, an insatiable appetite for building better
          tech. Today, those same forces unite hundreds of talents from
          different countries, serving over millions of daily users around the
          globe.
